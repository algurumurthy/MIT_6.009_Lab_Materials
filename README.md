# MIT_6.009_Lab_Materials
# Class taken at MIT in Sophomore Year (Fall 2020)
# All Class Lab Assignments encompassing the following topics:

# Lab 0: "Audio Processing"
- In this lab, I will examine the effects of various kinds of manipulations of audio represented in this form
# Lab 1: "Image Processing 1"
- In this lab, I built a few tools for manipulating digital images, akin to those found in image-manipulation toolkits like Photoshop and GIMP
# Lab 2: "Image Processing 2"
- Continuation of different manipulations from "Lab 1"
# Lab 3: "Bacon Number"
- In this lab, I will explore the notion of the Bacon number, and the implications of graph theory on modelling the idea of "7 degrees of separation"
# Lab 4: "Frugal Maps"
- In this lab, I will work with freely available1 real-world mapping data to solve the realistic large problem of finding the shortest (or fastest) path between 
  two points on a map. I implement the backend for a route-finding application, which we will be able to use to plan paths around Cambridge.
# Lab 5: "Minesweeper"
- In this lab, I will use recursion to solve the problem of creating an N-Dimensional "Minesweeper" game
# Lab 6: "SAT Solver"
- Utilization of "logic puzzles" to solve real-world issues like university "scheduling problems" for classes and exam times
# Lab 7: "Autocomplete"
- Implemented a BST-adjacent "Trie" structure based on Python dictionaries to set up a structure to efficiently "autocomplete" and "autocorrect" words used in text   files
# Lab 8: "Symbolic Algebra"
- In this lab, I  developed a Python framework for symbolic algebra. In such a system, algebraic expressions including variables and numbers are not immediately       evaluated but rather are stored in symbolic form
# Lab 9: "LISP 1"
- Built a Python interpreter for a dialect of the "LISP" language founded at MIT by John McCarthy in 1958. The interpreter is a high-level programming language and   was Turing-complete to solve any computational problem
# Lab 10: "LISP 2"
- A continuation of previous lab, LISP 1
